A matrix R is said to be in reduced row echelon form (RREF) if: 
1. All rows containing a non-zero entry are above rows which only contains zeros. 
2. The first non-zero entry in each non-zero row is l, called a leading one. 
3. The leading one in each non-zero row is to the right of the leading one in any 
row above it. 
4. A leading one is the only non-zero entry in its column. 
If A is row equivalent to a matrix R in RREF, then we say that R is the reduced row 
echelon form of A.
