A set V with an operation of addition, denoted F + j, and an operation of scalar 
multiplication, denoted cÆ, is called a vector space over R if for every v, x, y e V 
and c, d e R we have: 
There is a vector d e V, called the zero vector, such that .t+ö = d for all e V 
V4 
There exists an element e V, called the additive inverse of r, such that 
c(dF) — (ed)f 
VIO 
We call the elements of V vectors.
