Let A be an n x n matrix with eigenvalue RI. The algebraic multiplicity of Ill, 
denoted an, , is the number of times that A1 is a root of the characteristic polynomial 
= (A â€” where CI(AI) O, then 
Cu). That is, if caj 
= k. The 
geometric multiplicity of A, denoted gal , is the dimension of its eigenspace. So,
