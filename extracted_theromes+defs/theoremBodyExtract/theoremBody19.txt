(System-Rank Theorem) 
Let A be the coefficient matrix of a system of m linear equations in n unknowns 
(l) If the rank of A is less than the rank of the augmented matrix A I B l, then the 
system is inconsistent. 
(2) If the system A I b is consistent, then the system contains (n — rank A) free 
variables (parameters). 
(3) rank A = m if and only if the system A lb is consistent for every b €
