(Solution Theorem) 
Let [A I be a consistent system of m linear equations in n variables with RREF 
[R d]. If rank A = k < n, then a vector equation of the solution set of [A I has the 
form 
where R" and {131, . . , is a linearly independent set in R". In particular, the 
solution setof A I b] is ann k-flat in R".
