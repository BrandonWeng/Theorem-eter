If L, 
M, N e L and c, d e R, then 
V4 
There exists a linear mapping O : R" such that L + O = L for all L. In 
particular, O is the linear mapping defined by O(F) = for all r e R" 
There exists a linear mapping (—L) : * with the property that = 
O. In particular, (—L) is the linear mapping defined by — —L(f) for all 
Fee.
