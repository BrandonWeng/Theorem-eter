(Invertible Matrix Theorem) 
For any n x n matrix A, the following are equivalent: 
(1) 
A is invertible 
(2) The RREFofA is 
(3) 
rank A = n 
The system of equations AF = b is consistent with a unique solution for all 
(4) 
BeR" 
The nullspace of A is {d} 
(5) 
(6) 
The columns of A form a basis for 
(7) 
The rows of A form a basis for 
AT is invertible 
(8)
